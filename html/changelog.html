				<li class="tweak">Ripley now has an open cabin. This means it cannot protect against atmospheric dangers, and it does not provide the user cover from ranged attacks, but moves quicker and is slightly cheaper to manufacture.</li>

				<li class="balance">The hos's laser can only fire three taser shots instead of five.</li>
				<li class="balance">Energy crossbows have been reworked. They no longer paralyze, but instead heavily blur vision, apply a huge burst of stamina damage, and knock you on your ass for one second. Two shots is enough to down someone from stamina crit on both the mini and large versions. The blur lasts for 10 seconds.</li>

				<li class="rscadd">Fusion got reworked again. Start it using 250+ moles of plasma and carbon dioxide, with tritium, all at 10000 degrees.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Fusion undergoes a chaotic reaction, and will release energy(or absorb it with high instabilities), as well as releasing waste gases.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">To accommodate fusion, filters have been changed to move gas in the same way as volume pumps.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">As well, hitting a volume pump with a multitool will overclock it, allowing it to move gases to higher than normal pressures at the cost of leaking some of the contents.</li>

				<li class="rscadd">Assmilation has received a major update! remove: Kill, Maroon and Protect objectives have been removed from the mode.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Powers have been reorganized and are now unlocked in batches every five vessels. This gives hosts more power from the get-go and gives them distinct phases due to each batch affecting a specific area of the host's ability.</li>
				<li class="tweak">The psychic link pinpointer now starts off with very little time for hosts and must be strengthened by using Network Invasion. Each time a host is detected via NI, they can be tracked for an extra 30 seconds, and every successful use of NI increases the duration of all tracking by 10 seconds. A successful use of a new power, Reclaim, also increases the duration of all tracking by 30 seconds.</li>
				<li class="tweak">This means that without generous use of Network Invasion and Reclaim, hivemind hosts will lose their radar before Security does.</li>

				<li class="rscadd">Circadian Shift is a late-game power that sends everybody in sight to sleep for up to almost a minute. The more people affected, the less time it lasts, the minimum being eight seconds. remove: Mass Assimilation has been removed as Reclaim now fills its role.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Assimilate Vessel and Release Vessel's cooldown have been reduced to 5 seconds to reduce waiting time between assimilation attempts.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Bruteforce is no longer temporary, but immobilizes the user for five seconds after assimilation.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Hive Sight also lets you hear what the vessel does.</li>
